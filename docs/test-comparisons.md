# üõ† NFPA 70 PDF Processing Test Runs

This document tracks all test runs for the NFPA 70 PDF processing pipeline, including execution times, chunking performance, and areas for improvement.

## ‚úÖ Test 1: Initial Run (Fast but Inaccurate)
- **Date:** 2025-02-24 10:30:50  
- **Processing Time:** 30s  
- **Total Chunks:** 37  
- **Post-Chunking Character Count:** 8,446  
- **Content Similarity Ratio:** 1.64%  
- **Issues:**
  - GPT aggressively compressed the content.
  - Too much data was lost in chunking.
  - Context tags were mostly intact (94.6%), but sections may be missing.
- **Decision:** ‚ùå **Rejected** (Inaccurate due to content loss)

## ‚úÖ Test 2: Improved Accuracy (Slower)
- **Date:** 2025-02-24 19:43:57  
- **Processing Time:** 2m 48s  
- **Total Chunks:** 45  
- **Post-Chunking Character Count:** 60,711  
- **Content Similarity Ratio:** 24.62%  
- **Issues:**
  - Some GPT batches returned fewer chunks than expected.
  - A few chunks were empty (chunks 9, 24, 34, 37, 48, etc.).
  - Context tags missing in **42.2% of chunks**.
  - Processing took **5.6x longer** than Test 1.
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ **Kept as the working version, but needs speed optimizations.**

## üèóÔ∏è Next Steps & Fixes
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Investigate why GPT drops chunks in some batches**
   - Add logging to capture **the exact input sent to GPT** before chunking.
   - Check if **GPT truncates responses due to API limits**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize chunking to improve speed**
   - Adjust batch sizes to reduce processing time.
   - Balance chunk size to avoid over-summarization.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure all chunks have context tags**
   - Modify the chunking prompt to enforce metadata in every chunk.

## üõ† Automating Test Logging (To Be Implemented)
To streamline test tracking, the system should **automatically log each test run** into this Markdown file.  
Proposed logging script:

```python
from datetime import datetime

log_file = "documents/test_results.md"
with open(log_file, "a") as f:
    f.write(f"\n## ‚úÖ Test Run: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\n")
    f.write(f"- Processing Time: {total_time}s\n")
    f.write(f"- Total Chunks: {total_chunks}\n")
    f.write(f"- Content Similarity: {similarity_ratio:.2f}%\n")
    f.write(f"- Issues: {issues_found}\n")
    f.write(f"- Next Steps: {recommendations}\n\n")
