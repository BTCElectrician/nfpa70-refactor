# 🛠 NFPA 70 PDF Processing Test Runs

This document tracks all test runs for the NFPA 70 PDF processing pipeline, including execution times, chunking performance, and areas for improvement.

---

## ✅ Test 1: Initial Run (Fast but Inaccurate)
- **Date:** 2025-02-24 10:30:50  
- **Processing Time:** 30s  
- **Total Chunks:** 37  
- **Post-Chunking Character Count:** 8,446  
- **Content Similarity Ratio:** 1.64%  
- **Issues:**
  - GPT aggressively compressed the content.
  - Too much data was lost in chunking.
  - Context tags were mostly intact (94.6%), but sections may be missing.
- **Decision:** ❌ **Rejected** (Inaccurate due to content loss)

---

## ✅ Test 2: Improved Accuracy (Slower)
- **Date:** 2025-02-24 19:43:57  
- **Processing Time:** 2m 48s  
- **Total Chunks:** 45  
- **Post-Chunking Character Count:** 60,711  
- **Content Similarity Ratio:** 24.62%  
- **Issues:**
  - Some GPT batches returned fewer chunks than expected.
  - A few chunks were empty (chunks 9, 24, 34, 37, 48, etc.).
  - Context tags missing in **42.2% of chunks**.
  - Processing took **5.6x longer** than Test 1.
- **Decision:** ✅ **Kept as the working version, but needs speed optimizations.**

---

## ✅ Test 3: More Chunks, More Content, Slightly Slower
- **Date:** 2025-02-25 10:58:19  
- **Processing Time:** 4m 29s  
- **Total Chunks:** 53  
- **Post-Chunking Character Count:** 62,171  
- **Content Similarity Ratio:** 20.93% (Slight decrease from Test 2)  
- **Issues:**
  - **✅ Context tag coverage greatly improved (57.8% → 92.5%)**
  - **✅ More complete content (53 chunks vs. 45 in Test 2)**
  - **❌ Batch timeouts slowed down processing**
  - **❌ Content similarity ratio dropped slightly (24.62% → 20.93%)**
  - **❌ Some OCR errors slipped through (random garbled words in Test 3)**
- **Decision:** ✅ **Best version so far, but needs further speed optimizations and OCR cleanup.**

---

## 🔧 OCR Cleanup Fix (Newly Implemented)
We discovered that some **OCR errors were still slipping through**, even though GPT was cleaning the text.  
To prevent this, we **added an OCR preprocessing step before GPT sees the text.**  

### **How It Works**
1. **Regex Fixes for Common OCR Artifacts**  
   - Fixes things like `"l00"` → `"100"`  
   - Removes random `*`, extra spaces, and broken words.  

2. **TextBlob for Spell Correction**  
   - Dynamically corrects words that OCR distorted.  

3. **Pre-cleaning Before GPT Chunking**  
   - Runs before `_extract_raw_chunks()` in `text_chunker.py`.  

### **Code Implementation**
```python
import re
from textblob import TextBlob

def clean_ocr_text(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Cleans OCR errors before sending text to GPT for further processing.
    """
    # Step 1: Fix common OCR character swaps
    text = re.sub(r"[\*]", "", text)  # Remove weird asterisks
    text = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text)  # Fix extra spaces
    text = re.sub(r"l00", "100", text)  # Lowercase "L" misread as "1"
    text = re.sub(r"ELECfRIC..AL", "ELECTRICAL", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    text = re.sub(r"(?<!\w)l\.", "1.", text)  # Fix "l." being OCR misread for "1."
    text = re.sub(r"\bcmultutm-s\b", "conductors", text)

    # Step 2: Apply spell correction
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    corrected_text = str(blob.correct())

    # Step 3: Fix any remaining spacing/line break issues
    corrected_text = re.sub(r"\s+\.", ".", corrected_text)  # Fix misplaced spaces before periods
    corrected_text = re.sub(r"\s+,", ",", corrected_text)  # Fix misplaced spaces before commas

    return corrected_text
```

✅ **Now, OCR errors are fixed before GPT sees the text, reducing distortion in chunking.**  
🚀 **This will be tested in the next run.**

## 🏗️ Next Steps & Fixes
### **1️⃣ Investigate why GPT drops chunks in some batches**
   - Add logging to capture **the exact input sent to GPT** before chunking.
   - Check if **GPT truncates responses due to API limits**.

### **2️⃣ Optimize chunking to improve speed**
   - Adjust batch sizes to reduce processing time.
   - Balance chunk size to avoid over-summarization.
   - **Try reducing `batch_size=8` to `batch_size=6` to avoid timeouts.**

### **3️⃣ Ensure all chunks have context tags**
   - Modify the chunking prompt to enforce metadata in every chunk.
   - **Context tag accuracy improved in Test 3 (92.5%), but needs verification.**

### **4️⃣ Investigate Content Similarity Drop**
   - **Compare Test 2 vs. Test 3 outputs** to determine what GPT reformatted.
   - Identify **whether some content was altered or summarized incorrectly.**

### **5️⃣ Re-run with OCR Fix Applied**
   - Now that the **OCR cleanup is in place,** run a new test to confirm improvements.

## ⚡ Possible Further Optimizations
If you want to improve processing speed further:

- **🔄 Adjust Batch Size:** Reduce `batch_size` from **8** to **6** to reduce API timeouts.
- **⏳ Tune Timeout Settings:** The current settings might be **overly cautious**, causing unnecessary delays.
- **✂️ Simplify GPT Prompt:** A **shorter, more focused** prompt might yield **faster responses** without losing accuracy.
- **⏱ Handle Straggler Batches:** Implement a **timeout mechanism** for very slow batches to prevent hang-ups.

## 🛠 Automating Test Logging (To Be Implemented)
To streamline test tracking, the system should **automatically log each test run** into this Markdown file.  
Proposed logging script:

```python
from datetime import datetime

log_file = "documents/test_results.md"
with open(log_file, "a") as f:
    f.write(f"\n## ✅ Test Run: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\n")
    f.write(f"- Processing Time: {total_time}s\n")
    f.write(f"- Total Chunks: {total_chunks}\n")
    f.write(f"- Content Similarity: {similarity_ratio:.2f}%\n")
    f.write(f"- Issues: {issues_found}\n")
    f.write(f"- Next Steps: {recommendations}\n\n")
```
🚀 **Once this is implemented, each test run will log itself automatically!**

---

## 📜 Summary of Current Status
- **Current Best Version:** ✅ **Test 3 (More Chunks, More Content, Slightly Slower)**
- **Action Plan:** Improve speed while keeping accuracy.
- **Pending Fixes:** GPT chunk inconsistencies, processing delays, missing metadata.
- **New Change:** OCR cleanup now **runs before GPT chunking** to fix distortions.
